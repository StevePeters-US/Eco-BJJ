# Pressure

**Pressure** = force / area

In jiu jitsu it’s generally a slow grinding down of the defender. The attacker maintains strong attachments with the defender and applies force at control points on the defender to control their movement and force them to expend energy. It’s sometimes better to give fluid resistance than to try to make a firm block. We want our opponent to constantly exert energy while accomplishing nothing. In this way it becomes a game of attrition where we sap our opponents energy and with that, their will to fight. Be an energy vampire.

Like roots crack rocks we apply force strategically to weak points in our opponents defense.

## Contact patch
- Smaller contact patch produce more force in a smaller area. Total force doesn’t change relative to contact patch. Max downward force is attacker’s weight (double check that this is the correct term).

## Pulling up on attachments
- Attacker uses underhooks or gi grips to pull the defending player into the contact patch to increase total pressure.

## Lateral pressure
- Attacker drives from their feet using their ribs, shoulders, forearms, etc. lateral pressure is greatly affected by mat friction. Experiment with different foot positioning when applying lateral pressure. Drive down into the foot while pulling up to increase traction for more lateral pressure.

## Targets of Pressure
- **Diaphragm** - primary muscle that inflates the lungs. Responsible for deep breathing. Apply downward and lateral pressure to constrict. Curling the defender's spine into a concave shape compresses the lower abdominal organs against the diaphragm, further restricting it’s ability to pull air into the lungs. This is the correct time to tell dad jokes.
- **Elbows and knees** - apply downward and lateral force to the elbows and knees to rotate or topple frames.
