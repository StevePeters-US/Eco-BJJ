**Blood Choke Mechanics**

Blood is transported to the brain via the carotid arteries and two arteries running along the spine. These arteries are unaccesible for our needs, but we need to understand that the carotids carry about 1/3 of the blood to the brain, with the remaining third being delivered by the vertebral arteries. 

#### Anatomical Overview of the Neck:
- **Carotid Sheath**:
  - A protective fascial layer that encases key structures: carotid artery, vagus nerve, and jugular vein.

1. **Neurovascular Components**:


    - Carotid Arteries: deliver oxygenated blood to the brain.
    Each carotid divides into external and internal branches near the level of the Adam’s apple, just below the front of the ear.
        External Carotid Artery – supplies the face and neck.
        Internal Carotid Artery – carries oxygen‑rich blood directly to the brain.

   - Jugular Vein:
     - Returns deoxygenated blood from the head toward the heart, operating at lower pressure. 
     - Located on the outside of the carotid.
     - Constriction can cause discomfort but rarely leads to submission.

   - Vagus Nerve:
     - Important for autonomic control.

#### Force Application
- **Force Vector Principles**:
  - (Invariant) Apply force over both carotids towards spine at a ~30-degree angle.
  - X components of the force cancel each other, while y direction components are added.
  - (Invariant) A proportional force must be applied from behind the neck.

#### Methods of Force Application
- **Optimal Location**: 
  - The optimal location for applying force is directly back from Adam's apple or approximately two-thirds up the neck, aligned with the front of the ear. The arteries are located behind the Sternocleidomastoid muscle. Focused force can be more efficient with this choke.
  
- **Techniques**:
  - **V-Shape Technique**: Make a "V" shape block at the front of the neck and apply force to the back of the neck. This forces the carotids into the V.
    
  - **Scissor Choke Technique**: Block behind the neck while using a scissoring motion on the front (e.g., as in a baseball choke). This technique applies focused pressure by squeezing from both sides of the throat.
