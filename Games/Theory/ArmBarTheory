**Arm Bar Theory**

* The elbow as a hinge joint with only one degree of freedom.
* The elbow moves in a single plane.
* The arm in most people does not extend more than about 180 degrees although there are some exceptions.

**Breaking the Elbow Joint**

1. **Extension Past Full Range of Motion**: 
* This can be done by locking the arm to full extension via the shoulder and wrist, and applying force to the backside of the elbow
* Locking the shoulder and elbow, and applying force to the wrist.
2. **Compression**: Compress the joint by placing something (typically a forearm or shin) in the way that causes separation between the humerus and radius/ulna bones when the hinge joint is forced completely closed.

**3 Joint Rule**

To effectively break the arm, you must control both sides of the elbow (the shoulder and wrist), which is equivalent to controlling the ends of levers attached to a hinge joint.

**Arm bars using the legs, hips, and arms**

**Stabilizing the shoulder**
Break defender's posture towards the floor. Turn thier head if possible to further affect thier posture.

**Controlling the elbow**
The attacker hooks the defender's arm with the inside elbow of either thier head or hip side arm. Hooking with the head side arm allows the attacker to control the defender's legs somewhat.
The elbow must stay above the pelvic bone, otherwise attacking force vector goes through the forearm instead of the elbow

**Gaining control over the hand**
Most defender's will use one of a few variations of grips to prevent the extension of thier arm. Think of attacking these grips as similar to picking a lock. Keep tension on the tumbler to keep the pins in place while you pick it. You could always try smashing the lock if that doesn't work.

1.**Hook grip** - Strong in almost every direction and difficult to brute force. Unhook the grip by compressing the hands using the far side elbow.
2.**Palm to Palm** - This grip is strongest when the grips are perpendicular to each other. Altering this angle will weaken the grip. The ten finger grip (interlocked fingers) is a variation of the palm to palm which is strongest when the palms are directly facing each other.
There is a plane between the palms which can act as a weak point to seperate the grip. Attack from the wrist side by creating a structure with your arms which allows you to slice through the grip. Try using one arm as a prybar while applying force with the other, or twisting an arm through like a corkscrew.
3.**Fabric Grip** - This grip frees up the defender's far arm. The attacker can work a finger or thumb in from the top or bottom of the grip. The attacker can also compress the tips of the fingers to weaken the grip. If all else fails, go for the wrist lock.
