**Arm Bar Theory**

* The elbow as a hinge joint with only one degree of freedom.
* The elbow moves in a single plane.
* The arm in most people does not extend more than about 180 degrees although there are some exceptions.

**Breaking the Elbow Joint**

1. **Extension Past Full Range of Motion**: 
* This can be done by locking the arm to full extension via the shoulder and wrist, and applying force to the backside of the elbow
* Locking the shoulder and elbow, and applying force to the wrist.
2. **Compression**: Compress the joint by placing something (typically a forearm or shin) in the way that causes separation between the humerus and radius/ulna bones when the hinge joint is forced completely closed.

**3 Joint Rule**

To effectively break the arm, you must control both sides of the elbow (the shoulder and wrist), which is equivalent to controlling the ends of levers attached to a hinge joint.
