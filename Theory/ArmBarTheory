# Arm Bar Theory

* The elbow as a hinge joint with only one degree of freedom.
* The elbow moves in a single plane.
* The arm in most people does not extend more than about 180 degrees although there are some exceptions.

### Breaking the Elbow Joint

1. **Extension Past Full Range of Motion**: 
* This can be done by locking the arm to full extension via the shoulder and wrist, and applying force to the backside of the elbow
* Locking the shoulder and elbow, and applying force to the wrist.
2. **Compression**: Compress the joint by placing something (typically a forearm or shin) in the way that causes separation between the humerus and radius/ulna bones when the hinge joint is forced completely closed.

## 3 Joint Rule

To effectively break the arm, you must control both sides of the elbow (the shoulder and wrist), which is equivalent to controlling the ends of levers attached to a hinge joint.


## Arm Bars Using Legs, Hips, and Arms

### Stabilizing the Shoulder

* Break the defender's posture by bringing them down towards the floor
* Turn their head to further affect their posture

### Controlling the Elbow

* Hook the defender's arm with your inside elbow (either head or hip side)
* Hooking with the head side arm allows the attacker to control the defender's legs
* If the elbow is below the pelvic bone, the breaking force will travel through the defender's forearm instead of their elbow

### Gaining Control Over the Hand
Most defenders will use one of a few variations of grips to prevent the extension of thier arm. Think of attacking these grips as similar to picking a lock. Keep tension on the tumbler to keep the pins in place while you pick it. You could always try smashing the lock if that doesn't work.

## Types of Grips

1. **Hook Grip**
	* Strong in most directions
	* Difficult to brute force
	* Unhook by compressing the hands using the far side elbow
2. **Palm to Palm**
	* Strongest when grips are perpendicular to each other
	* Altering angle weakens grip
	* Weak point:
		- There is a plane between the palms which can act as a weak point to seperate the grip
		1. Attack from the wrist side by creating a structure with your arms that allows you to slice through the grip
			1. Use one arm as a prybar while applying force with the other
			2. Twist an arm through like a corkscrew
	* Variation: Ten Finger Grip (interlocked fingers)
		+ Strongest when palms are directly facing each other
3. **Fabric Grip**
	* Frees up defender's far arm
	* Work finger or thumb into top or bottom of grip
	* Compress tips of fingers to weaken grip
	* If all else fails, go for the wrist lock
4. **Palm to Wrist**
	* Usually involves the thumb which makes it diffcult to rotate or unhook the wrist
	* The thumb makes it more difficult to attack through the weak plane
	* Strongest when wide part of gripped wrist is against thumb webbing
	* Grip only uses strength of one hand
	* This grip is strongest when the wide part of the gripped wrist is against the thumb webbing. If the wrist is rotated so that the thin part of the wrist is against the webbing it unlocks the grip, allowing the arm to be twisted out.
