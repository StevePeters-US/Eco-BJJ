## Grips
A grip is an attachment of the hand to an object. 

Think of attacking grips as similar to picking a lock. Keep tension on the tumbler to keep the pins in place while you pick it. You could always try smashing the lock if that doesn't work.

## Types of Grips

1. **Hook Grip**
	* Strong in most directions
	* Difficult to brute force
	* Unhook by compressing the hands using the far side elbow
2. **Palm to Palm**
	* Strongest when grips are perpendicular to each other
	* Altering angle weakens grip
	* Weak point:
		- There is a plane between the palms which can act as a weak point to seperate the grip
		1. Attack from the wrist side by creating a structure with your arms that allows you to slice through the grip
			1. Use one arm as a prybar while applying force with the other
			2. Twist an arm through like a corkscrew
	* Variation: Ten Finger Grip (interlocked fingers)
		+ Strongest when palms are directly facing each other
3. **Fabric Grip**
	* Frees up defender's far arm
	* Work finger or thumb into top or bottom of grip
	* Compress tips of fingers to weaken grip
	* If all else fails, go for the wrist lock
4. **Palm to Wrist**
	* Usually involves the thumb which makes it diffcult to rotate or unhook the wrist
	* The thumb makes it more difficult to attack through the weak plane
	* Strongest when wide part of gripped wrist is against thumb webbing
	* Grip only uses strength of one hand
	* This grip is strongest when the wide part of the gripped wrist is against the thumb webbing. If the wrist is rotated so that the thin part of the wrist is against the webbing it unlocks the grip, allowing the arm to be twisted out.

## Elbow separation and it's effect on grip strength

Describe the effect of a seperating force on the grip (force applied in the opposite direction of the palm).
