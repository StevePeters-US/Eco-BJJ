### Blood Choke Mechanics

#### Anatomical Overview of the Neck:
- **Carotid Sheath**:
  - A protective fascial layer that encases key structures: carotid artery, vagus nerve, and jugular vein.

1. **Neurovascular Components**:
   - Carotid Arteries: 
     - Essential for providing oxygenated blood to the brain.
     - Both common carotids split into external and internal branches above the thyroid gland.
       - External Carotid Artery: Supplies blood to facial and neck regions.
       - Internal Carotid Artery: Directly provides oxygenated blood to the brain.

   - Jugular Vein:
     - Returns deoxygenated blood from the head toward the heart, operating at lower pressure. Constriction can cause discomfort but rarely leads to submission.

   - Vagus Nerve:
     - Important for autonomic control.

#### Force Application
- **Force Vector Principles**:
  - (Invariant) Apply force over both carotids towards spine at a ~30-degree angle.
  - X components of the force cancel each other, while y direction components are added.
  - (Invariant) A proportional force must be applied from behind the neck.

#### Methods of Force Application
- **Optimal Location**: 
  - The optimal location for applying force is directly back from Adam's apple or approximately two-thirds up the neck, aligned with the front of the ear. The arteries are located behind the Sternocleidomastoid muscle. Focused force can be more efficient with this choke.
  
- **Techniques**:
  - **V-Shape Technique**: Make a "V" shape block at the front of the neck and apply force to the back of the neck. This forces the carotids into the V.
    
  - **Scissor Choke Technique**: Block behind the neck while using a scissoring motion on the front (e.g., as in a baseball choke). This technique applies focused pressure by squeezing from both sides of the throat.
