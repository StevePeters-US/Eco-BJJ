      "content": "### Blood Choke Mechanics\n\n#### Anatomical Overview of the Neck:\n- **Carotid Sheath**:\n  - A protective fascial layer that encases key structures: carotid artery, vagus nerve, and jugular vein.\n\n1. **Neurovascular Components**:\n   - Carotid Arteries: \n     - Essential for providing oxygenated blood to the brain.\n     - Both common carotids split into external and internal branches above the thyroid gland.\n       - External Carotid Artery: Supplies blood to facial and neck regions.\n       - Internal Carotid Artery: Directly provides oxygenated blood to the brain.\n\n   - Jugular Vein:\n     - Returns deoxygenated blood from the head toward the heart, operating at lower pressure. Constriction can cause discomfort but rarely leads to submission.\n\n   - Vagus Nerve:\n     - Important for autonomic control.\n\n#### Force Application\n- **Force Vector Principles**:\n  - (Invariant) Apply force over both carotids towards spine at a ~30-degree angle.\n  - X components of the force cancel each other, while y direction components are added.\n  - (Invariant) A proportional force must be applied from behind the neck.\n\n#### Methods of Force Application\n- **Optimal Location**: \n  - The optimal location for applying force is directly back from Adam's apple or approximately two-thirds up the neck, aligned with the front of the ear. The arteries are located behind the Sternocleidomastoid muscle. Focused force can be more efficient with this choke.\n  \n- **Techniques**:\n  - **V-Shape Technique**: Make a \"V\" shape block at the front of the neck and apply force to the back of the neck. This forces the carotids into the V.\n    \n  - **Scissor Choke Technique**: Block behind the neck while using a scissoring motion on the front (e.g., as in a baseball choke). This technique applies focused pressure by squeezing from both sides of the throat.\n\n",

      "content": "\n## Grips\nA grip is an attachment of the hand to an object. \n\nThink of attacking grips as similar to picking a lock. Keep tension on the tumbler to keep the pins in place while you pick it. You could always try smashing the lock if that doesn't work.\n\n## Types of Grips\n\n1. **Hook Grip**\n\t* Strong in most directions\n\t* Difficult to brute force\n\t* Unhook by compressing the hands using the far side elbow\n2. **Palm to Palm**\n\t* Strongest when grips are perpendicular to each other\n\t* Altering angle weakens grip\n\t* Weak point:\n\t\t- There is a plane between the palms which can act as a weak point to seperate the grip\n\t\t1. Attack from the wrist side by creating a structure with your arms that allows you to slice through the grip\n\t\t\t1. Use one arm as a prybar while applying force with the other\n\t\t\t2. Twist an arm through like a corkscrew\n\t* Variation: Ten Finger Grip (interlocked fingers)\n\t\t+ Strongest when palms are directly facing each other\n3. **Fabric Grip**\n\t* Frees up defender's far arm\n\t* Work finger or thumb into top or bottom of grip\n\t* Compress tips of fingers to weaken grip\n\t* If all else fails, go for the wrist lock\n4. **Palm to Wrist**\n\t* Usually involves the thumb which makes it diffcult to rotate or unhook the wrist\n\t* The thumb makes it more difficult to attack through the weak plane\n\t* Strongest when wide part of gripped wrist is against thumb webbing\n\t* Grip only uses strength of one hand\n\t* This grip is strongest when the wide part of the gripped wrist is against the thumb webbing. If the wrist is rotated so that the thin part of the wrist is against the webbing it unlocks the grip, allowing the arm to be twisted out.\n\n## Elbow separation and it's effect on grip strength\n\nDescribe the effect of a seperating force on the grip (force applied in the opposite direction of the palm).\n",

      "title": "Pressure",
      "content": "# Pressure\n\n**Pressure** = force / area\n\nIn jiu jitsu it\u2019s generally a slow grinding down of the defender. The attacker maintains strong attachments with the defender and applies force at control points on the defender to control their movement and force them to expend energy. It\u2019s sometimes better to give fluid resistance than to try to make a firm block. We want our opponent to constantly exert energy while accomplishing nothing. In this way it becomes a game of attrition where we sap our opponents energy and with that, their will to fight. Be an energy vampire.\n\nLike roots crack rocks we apply force strategically to weak points in our opponents defense.\n\n## Contact patch\n- Smaller contact patch produce more force in a smaller area. Total force doesn\u2019t change relative to contact patch. Max downward force is attacker\u2019s weight (double check that this is the correct term).\n\n## Pulling up on attachments\n- Attacker uses underhooks or gi grips to pull the defending player into the contact patch to increase total pressure.\n\n## Lateral pressure\n- Attacker drives from their feet using their ribs, shoulders, forearms, etc. lateral pressure is greatly affected by mat friction. Experiment with different foot positioning when applying lateral pressure. Drive down into the foot while pulling up to increase traction for more lateral pressure.\n\n## Targets of Pressure\n- **Diaphragm** - primary muscle that inflates the lungs. Responsible for deep breathing. Apply downward and lateral pressure to constrict. Curling the defender's spine into a concave shape compresses the lower abdominal organs against the diaphragm, further restricting it\u2019s ability to pull air into the lungs. This is the correct time to tell dad jokes.\n- **Elbows and knees** - apply downward and lateral force to the elbows and knees to rotate or topple frames.\n",

Think of attacking these grips as similar to picking a lock. Keep tension on the tumbler to keep the pins in place while you pick it. You could always try smashing the lock if that doesn't work.\n\n## Types of Grips\n\n1. **Hook Grip**\n\t* Strong in most directions\n\t* Difficult to brute force\n\t* Unhook by compressing the hands using the far side elbow\n2. **Palm to Palm**\n\t* Strongest when grips are perpendicular to each other\n\t* Altering angle weakens grip\n\t* Weak point:\n\t\t- There is a plane between the palms which can act as a weak point to seperate the grip\n\t\t1. Attack from the wrist side by creating a structure with your arms that allows you to slice through the grip\n\t\t\t1. Use one arm as a prybar while applying force with the other\n\t\t\t2. Twist an arm through like a corkscrew\n\t* Variation: Ten Finger Grip (interlocked fingers)\n\t\t+ Strongest when palms are directly facing each other\n3. **Fabric Grip**\n\t* Frees up defender's far arm\n\t* Work finger or thumb into top or bottom of grip\n\t* Compress tips of fingers to weaken grip\n\t* If all else fails, go for the wrist lock\n4. **Palm to Wrist**\n\t* Usually involves the thumb which makes it diffcult to rotate or unhook the wrist\n\t* The thumb makes it more difficult to attack through the weak plane\n\t* Strongest when wide part of gripped wrist is against thumb webbing\n\t* Grip only uses strength of one hand\n\t* This grip is strongest when the wide part of the gripped wrist is against the thumb webbing. If the wrist is rotated so that the thin part of the wrist is against the webbing it unlocks the grip, allowing the arm to be twisted out.\n\n## Elbow separation and it's effect on grip strength\n\n\n## Far side shoulder influence on controlled shoulder\n\n",
